<h3> 
	Hello!<br> My name is Ani, and I'm an aspiring front-end developer with a strong passion for learning and growing in the world of web technologies. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive front-end development course, where I'm mastering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the groundwork for my future career.<br>

I'm a creative, detail-oriented, and persistent person, which helps me tackle any challenge and reach my goals. I believe that attention to detail is crucial, and I always strive to approach my work with precision and care. I see programming not only as a way to create beautiful and functional websites but also as an opportunity to combine my various interests and skills in a creative way.<br>

I have many hobbies that keep me inspired and fuel my creative spirit. I believe that people grow the most when they follow their passions and never stop learning new things.<br>

If you'd like to connect with me or exchange ideas, I'd love to hear from you!
